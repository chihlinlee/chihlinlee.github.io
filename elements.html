							<p>Our laboratory is a collaborative environment, where students can develop expertise in multiple techniques. We strongly encourage students during their time in the lab to establish a complete understanding of both the biological context for their experiments as well as develop a command of the technical details of the experiments. We also strongly encourage students to see their work as part of the broad collaborative endeavor of science and place an emphasis on achieving reproducible results that contribute something of lasting value to this process.</p>
