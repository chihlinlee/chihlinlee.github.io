								<h2>The Dangers of Dihydrogen Monoxide</h2>

							<h2>FAQs</h2>
							<h3>What is Dihydrogen Monoxide?</h3>
							<p>Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as Dihydrogen Oxide, Hydrogen Hydroxide, Hydronium Hydroxide, or simply Hydric acid. Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.
For more detailed information, including precautions, disposal procedures and storage requirements, refer to one of the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) available for DHMO</p>
							<h3>How dangerous is DHMO?</h3>
							<p>Although the U.S. Government and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) do not classify Dihydrogen Monoxide as a toxic or carcinogenic substance (as it does with better known chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and benzene), DHMO is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small as a spoonful. Each year, Dihydrogen Monoxide is a known causative component in many thousands of deaths and is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars in damage to property and the environment. Some of the known perils of Dihydrogen Monoxide are:
</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO, even in small quantities.</li>
											<li>Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.</li>
											<li>Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant though not typically life-threatening side-effects.</li>
											<li>DHMO is a major component of acid rain.</li>
											<li>Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.</li>
											<li>Contributes to soil erosion.</li>
											<li>Leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.</li>
										</ul>
							<h3>What is the link between Dihydrogen Monoxide and school violence?</h3>
							<p>A recent stunning revelation is that in every single instance of violence in our country's schools, including infamous shootings in high schools in Denver and Arkansas, Dihydrogen Monoxide was involved. In fact, DHMO is often very available to students of all ages within the assumed safe confines of school buildings. None of the school administrators with which we spoke could say for certain how much of the substance is in use within their very hallways.</p>
							<h3>How does Dihydrogen Monoxide toxicity affect kidney dialysis patients?</h3>
							<p>Unfortunately, DHMO overdose is not unheard of in patients undergoing dialysis treatments for kidney failure. Dihydrogen Monoxide overdose in these patients can result in congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema and hypertension. In spite of the danger of accidental overdose and the inherent toxicity of DHMO in large quantities for this group, there is a portion of the dialysis treated population that continues to use DHMO on a regular basis.</p>
