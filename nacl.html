								<h2>The Dangers of Monosodium Chloride</h2>
							</header>
							<h2>FAQs</h2>
							<h3>Is monosodium chloride an issue?</h3>
							<p>Monosodium chloride (MSC) is a common, toxic material, which governments have chosen to ignore in terms of protection of the population. It has a synonym, sodium monochloride.

MSC may be produced by reacting chlorine with sodium. Sodium is a highly reactive metal which can burst into flames in contact with water. It produces caustic soda during such a reaction. Caustic soda is, as the name implies, a very corrosive substance; a splash into the eye, for example, of a caustic soda solution may cause blindness within seconds. It is also reactive to light metals, such as aluminium and magnesium, and is therefore dangerous if found within aircraft, yet MSC is often provided to passengers. Chlorine is a highly toxic heavy gas, used in the manufacture of many products, such as dioxins.

MSC is found in rock deposits in many places throughout the world. Where close to the surface, its toxicity is such that most plants will die, although a few specialised species have evolved and can tolerate the presence of the toxin. They usually do this by exuding it to the surface of the leaves, where the MSC solidifies into the form of a powder and is blown off or washed off in rain, enabling the plant to survive.

MSC is soluble in dihydrogen monoxide and both substances are found in sea water. MSC is one of the compounds that are removed from sea water in desalination plants, designed to render it fit for human consumption as drinking water. Small amounts are frequently found in bottled mineral water as uncontrolled and undesired impurities. As far as is known, no government has controlled this undesired toxin in bottled waters</p>						

							<h3>What are the effects of MSC on humans?</h3>
							<p>The physiological effects of MSC in humans is partially documented. Small quantities can be found in all animal tissue and, indeed, may be considered as essential to human life. It becomes highly toxic in excess. Short-term symptoms of excess quantities include a raging thirst, dehydration, especially of internal organs and the brain, urine retention followed by frequent micturation, insufficient sudenation, kidney failure and death. Smaller quantities ingested regularly, such as by regularly eating food contaminated by MSC, will cause epistaxis, severe hypertension, unbalanced sodium:potassium ratio in body electrolytes, coronary thrombosis and cerebro-vascular accidents; either of the last two may result in severe disabilities and death. It is therefore clear that the presence of added MSC in foodstuffs should be prohibited by law. Yet something like 1,000,000,000,000 kilograms are produced annually throughout the world to supply chemical industry plants with raw material, as well as food producers</p>
							
							<h3>What is MSC used for?</h3>
							<p>In the chemical industry, the electrolytic decomposition of MSC is a principal source of toxic chlorine gas and caustic soda. These substances are often used for making other toxic compounds. For example, DDT, still used widely in many countries, carcinogens like epichlorohydrin, used in such household products as epoxy cements, and highly toxic sodium cyanide, much used in illegal gold extraction in the Amazon basin and elsewhere, would be almost impossible to manufacture without MSC.

Many authorities use large quantities of MSC for de-icing roads in winter, along with a closely allied compound, monocalcium dichloride (MCDC). The corrosive properties of these two substances cause untold damage to road vehicles, amounting to millions of dollars annually. In addition, the run-off from the treated roads causes pollution of surface water and, in the event of high concentration, may reduce the bacterial action during sewage treatment, further proof of its toxic effects on living organisms. It has also been noted that plants on roadside verges are often killed, because of the spray raised by the tyres of passing vehicles (note that another closely related compound, monosodium chlorate, has been used as a general weedkiller or phytocide for many decades). More enlightened authorities, in many countries, concerned about its toxic effects to both humans and plants and the damage it causes to material property, have entirely stopped using MSC and MCDC for deicing, or have drastically reduced its use. Incidentally, it has been shown that MSC spray from treated roads will be carried as an aerosol hundreds of metres and into buildings. Deposits on sensitive electronic apparati have been known to cause functional errors and breakdowns, potentially even creating a fire hazard, in the event of a short-circuit. The mechanism of this is by ionic conduction, which could lead to the release of highly toxic chlorine gas within the confines of the room.

The food industry is a major consumer of MSC. Many canned or reconstituted powder soups, for example, may contain it as a flavour enhancer, in proportions exceeding 1 or even 2 per cent. These products also contain DHMO in considerable proportions. Meat and fish processing is another major user as an artificial chemical preservative, along with nitrites. In some countries, even cheeses are dipped in or rubbed with a DHMO solution of MSC on a daily basis. Scotsmen and Scotswomen have even been known to add MSC when cooking their porridge or when making haggises. This may partially explain why Scotland has one of the highest rates of death due to cardiac disease in the world, with a considerably lower expectation of life than neighbouring England.</p>
